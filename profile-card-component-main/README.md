## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- I learnt about the css background property and its shorthand property to add various properties such as the position and size property.

- How to use the css grid to dynamically structure the layout of the page.

### Continued development

I'd like to advance my skills in css grid and get a grip on the various properties such as the place-item property

```
content {
  place-items: center;
}
```
