## My process

### Built with

- Astro.js
- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I learnt how to use npm create@astro to create whis particular website and working with sass and BEM in my workflow helped me to accomplish this road so far

### Continued development

I intend on working with Astro.js as it is the framework of the future to create more cool and awesome websites.
