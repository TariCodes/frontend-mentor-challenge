## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- LESS
- BEM

### What I learned

This project taught me how to use BEM, a methodology for naming classes and id's. Also I delved deeper on installing LESS and using it in my workflow. How to configure less-watcher to automatically watch changes in my less and css outputs.
I learnt how use the css-minify to minify my css codes.

### Continued development

I'd like to improve in my naming convention using the BEM methodology and getting more knowledge on LESS and using responsive font-sizes.
