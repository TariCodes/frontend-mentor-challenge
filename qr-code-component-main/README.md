## Overview

### Screenshot

![QRCode Component](screenshot/Screenshot-FrontendMentorQRcodeComponent.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- LESS

### What I learned

I learned how to markup contents using semantic html tag, styling it with LESS, although, I am new learning the LESS language it helps me construct and understand CSS better.

### Continued development

I struggle coming up with naming classes and id's, but I do wish to learn about structuring the page and contents semantically and improve in LESS cause I kinda love working with it, and in the future dive deep into learning TailwindCSS
