## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- LESS

### What I learned

I learned how to markup contents using semantic html tag, styling it with LESS, although, I am new learning the LESS preprocessor as it helps me construct and understand CSS better.

### Continued development

I do struggle coming up with naming classes and id's, but I do wish to learn about structuring the page and contents semantically and improve in LESS.
