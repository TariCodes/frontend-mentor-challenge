## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- LESS
- Gulp

### What I learned

From this project I learnt how to use the Gulp build tool in my workflow to help build and speed up my development setup. It is a faster tool to help with automating your developing process and save you from hassle

### Continued development

I would like to improve my skills on gulp and getting to use it more frequently to help build my less code and also try out tailwind css in future projects
